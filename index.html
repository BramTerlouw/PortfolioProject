        <article id="html-article" class="articleclass">
            <h1 class="skil-header">HTML5</h1>
            <p>
                HTML is the first skill i got to posses. I started learning this language on highschool,
                then i continued learning in collega about semantic tags, meta information and etc etc. I
                enjoy playing with it and im only beginning to discover what the possibility's are.

        <img id="img-css"
             class="skills-logos"
             alt="A picture with CSS3 logo"
             src="img/css.png" />
        <article id="css-article" class="articleclass">
            <h1 class="skil-header">CSS3</h1>
            <p>
                CSS is the second skill i posses. Just like HTMl i got into css in highschool and continued to 
                learn it through college. Sometimes it can be a bit tidious but when i discoverd flexbox, grid
                and media querries, it became a lot easier.

        <img id="img-cSharp"

        <article id="cSharp-article" class="articleclass">
            <h1 class="skil-header">C Sharp</h1>
            <p>
                C# or CSharp is the language im currently practicing quite often. I really like the language
                and all the possibility's you have with it. It's a lot harder then other things i've done but
                i enjoy the learning curve and everything that comes with it.
